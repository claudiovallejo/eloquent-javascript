# Introduction
"This is a book about getting computers to do what you want them to do."

## On Programming
"Programming...is hard. The fundamental rules are typically simple and clear. But programs built on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity."

"A program is many things. It is a piece of text typed by a programmer; it is the directing force that makes the computer do what it does; it is data in memory."

"The reason [computers] are so useful is that they do these things at an incredibly high speed. A program can ingeniously combine an enormous number of these simple actions in order to do very complicated things."

"Keeping programs under control is the main problem of programming."

## What Is JavaScript?
"JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser."

"After JavaScript's widespread adoption, a standard document was writtern to describe the way the language should work to make sure the various pieces of software that claimed to spport JavaScript were actually talking about the same language. This is called the ECMAScript standard..."

"JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The idea behind this design was that it would make programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder because the system will not point them out to you."

## Code, and What to Do with it
"Code is the text that makes up programs."

"...reading code and writing code are indispensible parts of learning to program..."
