      <h2>FizzBuzz</h2>
      <p>Write a program that uses `console.log` to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.<br>When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.<br>(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, you're now allowed to feel good about yourself.)</p>
