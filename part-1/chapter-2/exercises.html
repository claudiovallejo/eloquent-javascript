      <h1>Minimum</h1>
      <p>The previous chapter introduced the standard function `Math.min` that returns its smallest argument. We can do taht ourselves now. Write a function `min` that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.</p>
      <div class="js-1"></div>
    </div>

      <h1>Recursion</h1>
      <p>We've seen that `%` (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using `% 2` to check whether it's divisible by two. Here's another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zero is even</li>
        <li>One is odd</li>
        <li>For any other number <i>N</i>, its evenness is the same as <i>N - 2</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Define a recursive function `isEven` corresponding to this description. The function should accept a `number` parameter and return a Boolean.</p>
      <p>Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?</p>

      <h1>Bean Counting</h1>
      <p>You can get the <i>N</i>th character, or letter, from a string by writing `string.charAt(N)`, similar to how you get its length with `s`.length. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, `b`). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to be found as position `string.length - 1`. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.</p>
      <p>Write a function `countBs` that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase `B` characters are in the string.</p>
      <p>Next, write a function called `countChar` that behaves like `countBs`, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase `B` characters). Rewrite `countBs` to make use of this new function.
